Hotsock pricing is now a **simple flat rate** - **$99/month** or **$999/year** per AWS account. No usage-based tiers, no per-million-message overage charges, no surprises on your bill. Just **unlimited messages** at a predictable cost.

### What changed

Previously, Hotsock used a usage-based pricing model with multiple tiers based on monthly message volume. Each tier came with a base price and per-million-message overage charges if you exceeded the included messages. This made costs difficult to predict, especially for applications with variable or growing traffic.

The new model is straightforward: **$99/month** or **$999/year** per AWS account. That's it. No tiers to evaluate, no usage calculations, no overage fees.

### What you get

Every Paid Tier license includes:

- **Unlimited messages** - no caps, no overages, no throttling
- **Unlimited concurrent connections** - scale to as many connected clients as you need
- **Unlimited installations** - run as many dev, staging, and production stacks as you want
- **[All supported AWS regions](/docs/installation/region-support/)** - deploy wherever your users are
- **[Premium support](/docs/licensing/pricing#premium-support)** - contextual, application-specific guidance for your installations

### Free Tier stays free

Nothing has changed for the Free Tier. You still get **1 million messages per month**, forever, with no credit card required. It remains the best way to get started and evaluate Hotsock for your use case.

### Get started
