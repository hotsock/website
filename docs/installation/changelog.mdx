# Changelog

## v1.5.1 - August 9, 2025 {#v1.5.1}

- Build with Go 1.24.6.
- Update all aws-sdk-go-v2 SDK modules to their latest versions (as of [2025-08-08](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/releases/tag/release-2025-08-08)).

## v1.5.0 - July 23, 2025 {#v1.5.0}

- Add support for scheduling messages for future delivery. Specify [`scheduleExpression`](../server-api/publish-messages.mdx#message-format.scheduleExpression) and, optionally, [`scheduleExpressionTimezone`](../server-api/publish-messages.mdx#message-format.scheduleExpressionTimezone) when publishing messages with Lambda, HTTP URL, or client WebSocket or HTTP. For client requests, the event-level [`scheduleBefore`](../connections/claims.mdx#channels.messages.scheduleBefore) permission claim is required. This feature is backed by [Amazon EventBridge Scheduler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/using-eventbridge-scheduler.html) and allows scheduling one-time message events (recurring schedules are not currently supported in Hotsock).
- Server-initiated message publishing requests now return more helpful error info in the HTTP or Lambda response body.
- In addition to publishing messages via the WebSocket, the web console provides interface options for sending standard and raw messages using the client HTTP API.
- The web console now displays a timestamp alongside messages so you can see when each message was sent or received.
- Update all aws-sdk-go-v2 SDK modules to their latest versions (as of [2025-07-22](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/releases/tag/release-2025-07-22)).

## v1.4.0 - July 15, 2025 {#v1.4.0}

- Add the ability to disable connection count tracking for channel subscriptions with [`omitFromSubCount`](../connections/claims.mdx#channels.omitFromSubCount). This is an optional cost reduction measure for cases where the count of subscribers in a channel changes frequently and tracking that count is unneeded.
- Fix an issue where some item remove events were not triggering event bus events.
- Dualstack mode is enabled for the WebSocket API, providing both IPv4 and IPv6 support for client WebSocket connections.
- Build with Go 1.24.5.
- Update all aws-sdk-go-v2 SDK modules to their latest versions (as of [2025-07-15](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/releases/tag/release-2025-07-15)).

## v1.3.2 - April 2, 2025 {#v1.3.2}

- Work around known bug in API Gateway where `GoneException` is occasionally returned when a connection is still alive.
- Build with Go 1.24.2.
- Update all aws-sdk-go-v2 SDK modules to their latest versions (as of [2025-04-02](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/releases/tag/release-2025-04-02)).

## v1.3.1 - February 12, 2025 {#v1.3.1}

- Fix an issue where the `connectedAt` timestamp on a stored `ConnectionItem` did not match API Gateway's connection timestamp - it was off by a few milliseconds. These values are now synchronized.
- Build with Go 1.24.0.
- Update all aws-sdk-go-v2 SDK modules to their latest versions.

## v1.3.0 - October 14, 2024 {#v1.3.0}

- Add long-term message storage. Set the [`store`](../server-api/publish-messages.mdx#message-format.store) parameter for server-initiated message publishes or set the [`store`](../connections/claims.mdx#channels.messages.store) claim for client-initiated messages to an integer number in seconds to specify how long messages should be retained.
- Include `connectionSecret` in `hotsock.connected` message, which when combined with the connection ID is an API key that can make HTTP requests to the HTTP API to list and publish messages for a channel.
- Add [`historyStart`](../connections/claims.mdx#channels.historyStart) claim to specify the timestamp of how far back a connection can query for past messages using the HTTP API.
- Reduce the HTTP API timeout from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
- Add CORS support to the HTTP API.
- Improve performance of the `hotsock.connected` message. Where this message was previously received 300-600ms after the connection was established, it is now received within 30-60ms.
- Switch the DynamoDB Streams `FilterCriteria` patterns to use the object type (`T`) attribute value to determine if it should be consumed by the stream processor instead of using arbitrary key prefixes/suffixes.
- Improve log redaction of API keys and connection secrets.
- Add stream processor metrics that are published from logs using CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF).

## v1.2.0 - September 23, 2024 {#v1.2.0}

- Switch from AWS Managed KMS Key to AWS Owned Key for DynamoDB table encryption to avoid cost issues with concurrent UpdateItem calls trigging tons of `kms:Decrypt` operations. A future release can offer KMS/CMK as an explicit opt-in where such costs are acceptable.
- Change the main table batch size for DynamoDB Stream processing from 100 to 1000 and add a filter pattern so only specific keys are processed.
- Always use SNS `PublishBatch()` instead of single `Publish()` calls to maximize throughput.

## v1.1.0 - August 29, 2024 {#v1.1.0}

- Add a "Pre-warm environment" (`PreWarmEnvironmentParameter`) CloudFormation option to keep all time-sensitive, user-facing Lambda functions warm using a one-per-minute scheduled invocation. Designed for staging or demo environments where traffic often drops to zero, but where you don't want noticeable cold starts when usage resumes.
- Set `MemorySize: 1769` for the main table stream processor to give it a full vCPU.

## v1.0.0 - August 27, 2024 {#v1.0.0}
