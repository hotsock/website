# Region Support ðŸŒŽ

Choose a nearby AWS region. All of your server-initiated messages will be routed through endpoints in this region and all clients will connect to a WebSocket endpoint in this region.

For the lowest possible latency, we recommend choosing the same region as or the closest region to your application infrastructure. You can create installations in multiple regions if your application spans multiple regions.
