# Presence Channels

Presence channels build on [standard channels](./standard.mdx) by allowing all subscribers to know information (ID and a custom data payload) about all other subscribers as they join and leave the channel.

It's great for things like chat rooms and document collaboration, where everyone there can be made aware of who else is present.

Each member in a presence channel has a `uid` field to identify the user and a `umd` field to supply additional data specific to this user. These attributes are supplied by authentication or subscription token claims ([`uid`](../connections/claims.mdx#uid) and [`umd`](../connections/claims.mdx#umd)) and shared with all other members of the channel.

:::tip
Presence channel names must have a `presence.` prefix.

## Limits

Whenever someone leaves or joins a presence channel, all members of the channel receive a message containing the `uid` and `umd` of all other members.

**There is no fixed user count limit on presence channels, but the sum total size of all subscribed member payloads (`{"uid":"...","umd":"..."}`) must not exceed 100KB.** Attempting to subscribe to a presence channel that would put the subscriber over this limit will fail with a `PRESENCE_CHANNEL_CAPACITY_REACHED` WebSocket error.

For example, a presence channel could hold ~100 users with 1KB of user data each or ~800 users with 200 bytes of user data each.

## Subscribe

Once connected to the WebSocket with a token authorizing subscribe on the `presence.live-chat` channel, subscribe by sending a message on the WebSocket.

```
> {"event":"hotsock.subscribe", "channel":"presence.live-chat"}
```

You'll immediately receive confirmation of the subscription with a `hotsock.subscribed` message. The `data` attribute will indicate that you're the only subscriber.

```
< {"event":"hotsock.subscribed","channel":"presence.live-chat","data":{"members":[{"uid":"Jim","umd":null}]},"meta":{"uid":"Jim","umd":null}}
```

Let's say Dwight joins the channel from another connection. Dwight will receive a `hotsock.subscribed` message similar to the one you received above, but it will indicate that both you and him are present in the channel.

You will receive a `hotsock.memberAdded` message. The `data` attribute contains the `member` who was just added (Dwight) and a list (array) of all current members (you and Dwight).

```
< {"event":"hotsock.memberAdded","channel":"presence.live-chat","data":{"member":{"uid":"Dwight","umd":null},"members":[{"uid":"Jim","umd":null},{"uid":"Dwight","umd":null}]}}
```

Here the `member` who was added was Dwight and `members` now contains both of you.

If Dwight unsubscribes from the channel, you'll receive a `hotsock.memberRemoved` message.

```
{"event":"hotsock.memberRemoved","channel":"presence.live-chat","data":{"member":{"uid":"Dwight","umd":null},"members":[{"uid":"Jim","umd":null}]}}
```

Here the `member` who was removed was Dwight and `members` no longer includes him.

If you're subscribing and responding to messages using client-side JS, take a look at [hotsock-js](https://www.github.com/hotsock/hotsock-js) where all of the above is handled by the library.

## Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe from a channel, send a `hotsock.unsubscribe` message on the WebSocket.

```
> {"event":"hotsock.unsubscribe", "channel":"presence.live-chat"}
```

Other members of the presence channel will receive a `hotsock.memberRemoved` message indicating that you left, if anyone else is still present.

When disconnecting the WebSocket connection, `hotsock.unsubscribe` is called automatically on your behalf for any subscribed channels, notifying anyone still present that you've left.
