# Connect & Subscribe

Now that you're able to [sign tokens](./authentication.mdx) with the [correct claims](./claims.mdx), we'll use a token to connect to the WebSocket, subscribe to a channel, and publish/receive messages from the command line.

The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how the pieces fit together - signing, connecting, subscribing, and message publishing.

If you want to try things out with a point-and-click graphical interface instead, check out the [web console](../server-api/web-console.mdx).

## Sign a token

First, we'll sign a token with an [`exp`](./claims.mdx#exp) claim, a [`scope`](./claims.mdx#scope) claim, and a [`channels`](./claims.mdx#channels) claim for the "get-started-with-hotsock" channel allowing subscribe.

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
{
  "exp": 1693963905,
  "channels": {
    "get-started-with-hotsock": {
      "subscribe": true
    }
  },
  "scope": "connect"
}
```

The signed, encoded token value is `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2OTM5NjM5MDUsImNoYW5uZWxzIjp7ImdldC1zdGFydGVkLXdpdGgtaG90c29jayI6eyJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOnRydWV9fSwic2NvcGUiOiJjb25uZWN0In0.Ls62aNTexRTZGJfp5ei-hUO4XwhEn5hwgxBuUPD77k4`. [Here's the encoded/decoded breakdown](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2OTM5NjM5MDUsImNoYW5uZWxzIjp7ImdldC1zdGFydGVkLXdpdGgtaG90c29jayI6eyJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOnRydWV9fSwic2NvcGUiOiJjb25uZWN0In0.Ls62aNTexRTZGJfp5ei-hUO4XwhEn5hwgxBuUPD77k4) of this token.

In a real application, a signed token is safe to give to client applications. If it is tampered with in any way before being used, its signature will no longer be valid and the system will reject it from being used.

## Connect to the WebSocket

Using the [`WebSocketsAwsWssUrl`](../installation/initial-setup.mdx#WebSocketsAwsWssUrl) value from the CloudFormation stack output, connect to the WebSocket using [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat). In a real-world application you'd likely connect with a web browser or other client device, but `wscat` demonstrates the process.

Set the token value in the `token` query parameter (note the `?token=eyJ...` portion for setting the query parameter).

```
wscat -c "wss://1ycut2oy9h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE2OTM5NjM5MDUsImNoYW5uZWxzIjp7ImdldC1zdGFydGVkLXdpdGgtaG90c29jayI6eyJzdWJzY3JpYmUiOnRydWV9fSwic2NvcGUiOiJjb25uZWN0In0.Ls62aNTexRTZGJfp5ei-hUO4XwhEn5hwgxBuUPD77k4"
Connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
< {"event":"hotsock.connected","data":{"connectionId":"JCnTZd_KoAMCF-A="}}
>
```

If the token is valid, you'll be connected and will receive an initial `hotsock.connected` message containing the connection ID. 🎉

## Subscribe to a channel

You're connected, but are not subscribed to any channels. Until you subscribe, you won't receive any messages (except for [periodic keep-alive messages](./keep-alive.mdx), if enabled).

Let's subscribe to the "get-started-with-hotsock" channel authorized in the token. Send a message with the `hotsock.subscribe` event to the `get-started-with-hotsock` channel in JSON format.

```
> {"event":"hotsock.subscribe", "channel":"get-started-with-hotsock"}
```

You'll immediately receive confirmation of the subscription.

```
< {"event":"hotsock.subscribed","channel":"get-started-with-hotsock","data":{},"meta":{"uid":null,"umd":null}}
```

Now, any messages sent to the "get-started-with-hotsock" channel will be sent to you, the only current subscriber of this channel.

## Send and receive a message

### Lambda direct function invocation

Using the AWS CLI, we'll invoke the function from [`PublishFunctionArn`](../installation/initial-setup.mdx#PublishFunctionArn) to send a message to our channel. Copy the Arn from the stack output to the function name argument.

```
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:Hotsock-Publishing-1K4R55PICWM9Q-PublishFunction-ZsQtKbbCqUVF \
  --payload '{"channel":"get-started-with-hotsock", "event":"welcome", "data":"👋 Hello from Hotsock! こんにちは"}' \
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  /dev/stdout
```

The expected response to this function invocation is `{"id":null,"channel":"get-started-with-hotsock","event":"welcome"}`. More details on publishing with Lambda as well as request and response attributes in [message publishing](../server-api/publish-messages.mdx#publish-with-lambda).

Over in your WebSocket connection window, the published message will be received by you, the channel subscriber.

```
< {"id":"01H2BSNHFJXKF2XDFD8KMM36FF","event":"welcome","channel":"get-started-with-hotsock","data":"\ud83d\udc4b Hello from Hotsock! \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f"}
```

If you repeatedly invoke the publish function, you'll see additional messages received on the WebSocket.

### HTTP URL

As an alternative to using the AWS SDK to invoke Lambda directly, you can send backend-initiated messages using a standard HTTPS POST request.

Grab the [`PublishHttpApiUrl`](../installation/initial-setup.mdx#PublishHttpApiUrl) CloudFormation stack output value for the URL. The secret key is a 40-character string that can be found on the page provided in the [`HttpApiSecretKey1ConsoleUrl`](../installation/initial-setup.mdx#HttpApiSecretKey1ConsoleUrl) or [`HttpApiSecretKey2ConsoleUrl`](../installation/initial-setup.mdx#HttpApiSecretKey2ConsoleUrl) output.

Given a URL of `https://k6rcy6a2leyehqhlphlwkkuppm0xxubn.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/publish` and a primary secret value of `BFS164OqJg0UHy0q8cfU6QvUo23kB0lPX1fb9Hae`, we'll make a POST request with cURL to that endpoint with the secret key set as a `Bearer` token in the Authorization header.

```
curl -X "POST" "https://k6rcy6a2leyehqhlphlwkkuppm0xxubn.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/publish" \
     -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer BFS164OqJg0UHy0q8cfU6QvUo23kB0lPX1fb9Hae' \
     -d $'{
        "channel": "get-started-with-hotsock",
        "event": "welcome",
        "data": "👋 Hello from Hotsock! こんにちは"
      }'
```

The expected response to this request is `{"id":null,"channel":"get-started-with-hotsock","event":"welcome"}` with a `202 Accepted` HTTP response code. More details on publishing with HTTP as well as request and response attributes in [message publishing](../server-api/publish-messages.mdx#publish-with-http-url).

Over in your WebSocket connection window, the published message will be received by you, the channel subscriber.

```
< {"id":"01H2C4Z3PFFJR6RG5D6A12HM92","event":"welcome","channel":"get-started-with-hotsock","data":"\ud83d\udc4b Hello from Hotsock! \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f"}
```

If you change the event name or the data value in the request payload and repeatedly submit the request, you'll see additional messages received on the WebSocket.
