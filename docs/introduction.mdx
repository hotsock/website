## Deploy to AWS regions around the world

Choose a region closest to your application and users to achieve the lowest possible latency. [See available regions →](installation/region-support.mdx)

## Security on your terms

Since it installs to your AWS account, you own all the data and its functionality is bound to your policies.

You own the data forever, and only you can access it.

# Serverless

Hotsock runs entirely on AWS managed, Serverless, multi-datacenter, pay-as-you-go, auto-scaling services.

There's never anything for you to manage, no servers to maintain or patch, no scaling knobs to turn. It just works and you're only paying for actual usage.
